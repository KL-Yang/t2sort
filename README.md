T<sup>2</sup>Sort
=============

Start a Toy project to practice my C++ skill.
Terabyte Trace Sort.

Problem.
=========
Use up to a few GB memory as first level buffer and up to a few TB disk as second level buffer
to sort trace flow in arbitrary order to another arbitrary order on single commodity PC.

Assume sequential I/O of second level buffer is much faster than random I/O.
The algorithm try to maximum second level buffer (disk) I/O bandwidth.
